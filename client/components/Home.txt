___Update/Delete functionality on country components__

SelectCountry component is returning the country name string, not the country object.

The country property on state refers to my callback function and the string, not the country object

***Can I get the correct country object on state without having to do an async request to the backend for a specific country?***

___Viewing + Editing associations__

***SOLUTION:
1. do eager loading in queries instead of model
2. filter allAircraft.countryId held on front end state

Problem: Have to add country ownership on aircraft view, currently have countryId on aircraft model only.

How can (and should) I load Countries onto Aircraft?

Tried eager loading just like aircraft on countries, but previous attempt broke model, also would seem redundant.

Possible to filter the correct country directly from state with ID property?

Or is another async call required?
